TODO
    - Test with different inputs
        - Unit tests indicate code is working properly
        - Just need to verify data is passed from and to GitHub actions correctly
            - Workflow:
                - After unit tests run successfully
                - Two files should be generated: an inputs file "I", and a result file "R"
                - "I" should contain all inputs with modified values than default
                - "R" contains the result of running these inputs on a real GitHub account
                - Call the GitHub action using inputs from "I"
                - Validate that the produced file is the same as the "R"
                - Questions
                    - How to load inputs from a file?
                        - Check how to save stuff between jobs ($GITHUB_OUTPUT)
    - Configurable username which defaults to the repository owner
    - Configurable sort?
    - Repos ignore?
    - Use monthsInterval in mock

- User needs to configure which getContributions function to use
- Let them enter a string in GET_CONTRIBUTIONS_FN
- According to the string, inject the function into getContributionsMarkdown
